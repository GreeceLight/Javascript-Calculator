# Javascript-Calculator
This is a calculator project given to me by the Odin Project

All functions of this calculator work as intended as well as allowing for multiple calculations to be done in one set before pressing the = button

Calculator has full keyboard support as well as a clear and delete function
The PRTY button is a special button that I did for fun! ***Epilepsy warning***
